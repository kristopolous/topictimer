Podcast topic timer
===

Podcasts work better when you timebox topics and segue to new ones quickly. The pacing is as if not more important than the content itself.

I was looking for some software that you could enter topics and durations and it would try to keep you on a timeline but for some remarkable reason
this didn't seem to exist.

## UNTIL NOW!

This will eventually be something that mere non-technical humans can use ... but as of now it's just something that you need to have programming skillz to do.

Here's an example for what will be my upcoming podcast for 04/12/2019.

### Some future features:

  * Accounts and stuff.
  * Saving and naming timelines.
  * Sharing them with co-hosts via some collaboration thingie.
  * Some way to do sub-topic-ing
  * Timer controls:
    * start/stop/rewind
    * a way to quickly "mark" the timeline if you go over or under. 

The last one is important. If you plan 2 minutes but you're done in 1.5 and the next one is a 3 minute topic, you still want to keep that at 3 minutes ... going quickly early on isn't an excuse to lag later on - slowness kills listeners.  So in the magical world where this feature worked, you could quickly interact at the moment you are transitioning to the next topic and the timeline will "auto-adjust" so you can hit the mark with everything else.

### When will this magic be done?

Who the heck knows ... I am so busy. I mean come on.
